# mwr-1.15
Modern Warfare Remastered 1.15 PS4

This is a small WIP project that aims to add additional features to the game.
This project compiles to a .elf file which can be loaded with the help of payloads such as Frame4 or ps4debug on a jailbroken PlayStation 4.


## Goals
- Local Engine/LUI drawing menu ✓
- All client menu with hud elements ✓
- Forge Mode
- Gamemodes (Zombieland, possibly AI Zombies, ...)


## Building
In order to build this project, you need the linux sub system installed for Windows 10 with clang.
The project has a visual studio solution using post build events to build with wsl.
Optionally you can build with just the linux shell.
